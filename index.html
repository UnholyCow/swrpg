        <h2>Kuat Drive Yards Memo</h2>
        <p>With the 'internal' attack on Kuat Drive Yards we have recieved an Imperial Order. Either we improve our security or the local Moff will do it for us. I was barely able to keep them from taking the whole damn planet in the name of 'safety'. Either way we'll have Destroyers in orbit in the next few days.</p>
        <p>I want information on Pato Sosen on my desk tomorrow morning. We need to know who or what made this guy snap. If we have another incident like this I don't think I can keep Moff Jorsa from suggesting the Emperor simply absorb KDY.</p>
        <span class="stinger aurebesh">We all know the truth. Eventually the Empire will too.</span>
