				<p>Anyone being caught abusing the temporary outage of records will be imprisoned for no less than 10 standard Imperial years, their assets siezed, and known friends and family questioned.</p>

				<h2>FR4NC15</h2><h2 class="corner">-5 Bounty</h2>
				<p>Reom knows a guy inside the Imperial bounty system and managed to get your name stricken. It looks like it went well, can't find anything else public about you. Classified chatter was insane though...</p>
				<span class="stinger aurebesh">The Empire still wants their property back.</span>

				<h2>Hayynq</h2><h2 class="corner">-5 Obsession</h2>
				<p>It kind of cost us but we diverted supplies to some of the nonhuman refugees on the Outer Rim. The Hutts hit some of the shipments but it looks like a lot of people still got the help they needed.</p>

				<h2>Nysro</h2><h2 class="corner">-5 Criminal</h2>
				<p>Reom sent some of the guys to hit a security station where the Imperials were holding some evidence against you. The entire building is a husk, there's no way they can stick some of what IsoTech does on your head any more.</p>
				<span class="stinger aurebesh">Things will only get worse before the end.</span>

			<div class="info">
				<h2>Rusku</h2><h2 class="corner">-5 Bounty</h2>
				<p>We had to dig pretty deep to even find where to "fix" your bounty. The slicers we paid off still don't know who even put the mark on you but they really, really hate you.</p>
				<span class="stinger aurebesh">Do not think your secrets have gone without notice.</span>

			<div class="info">
				<h2>TK</h2><h2 class="corner">+15 Criminal</h2>
				<p>We have some bad news, poking around for the rest of your crew eventually led to an Imperial communique. Stormtrooper Command is pissed that a defector even exists, let alone lives. We keep hearing chatter about Lord Vader...watch your back...</p>
