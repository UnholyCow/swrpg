				<h2>Terrorists Attack Raxus Prime</h2>
				<p>The Imperial shipyard located at Raxus Prime was attacked by an extremist group. earlier this week. Intelligence confirms their targets were the orbital docks though local system patrol craft were able to intervene before much damage was done.</p>
				<p>Of the many craft used in the attack only two severely damaged CEC starships remained, one YT-1300 and a CR90 corvette. If you have any information that leads to the apprehension of the attackers a 3,000 <span class="aurebesh">$</span> bounty will be awarded.</p>

				<p>Reom knows a guy inside the Imperial bounty system and managed to get your name stricken. It looks like it went well, can't find anything else public about you. Classified chatter was insane though...</p>

				<h2>Hayynq</h2><h2 class="corner">-5 Obsession</h2>
				<p>It kind of cost us but we diverted supplies to some of the nonhuman refugees on the Outer Rim. The Hutts hit some of the shipments but it looks like a lot of people still got the help they needed.</p>

				<h2>Nysro</h2><h2 class="corner">-5 Criminal</h2>
				<p>Reom sent some of the guys to hit a security station where the Imperials were holding some evidence against you. The entire building is a husk, there's no way they can stick some of what IsoTech does on your head any more.</p>

				<h2>Rusku</h2><h2 class="corner">-5 Bounty</h2>
				<p>We had to dig pretty deep to even find where to "fix" your bounty. The slicers we paid off still don't know who even put the mark on you but they really, really hate you.</p>

				<h2>TK</h2><h2 class="corner">+15 Criminal</h2>
				<p>We have some bad news, poking around for the rest of your crew eventually led to an Imperial communique. Stormtrooper Command is pissed that a defector even exists, let alone lives. We keep hearing chatter about Lord Vader...watch your back...</p>
