				<h2>GAMBLER'S LUCK</h2>
				<h3>11.15.2015</h3>
				<div class="sessionText">
					<p>IsoTech, now mostly based on a barely spaceworthy Corellian corvette, begins the long process of rebuilding. Weeks in deep space and hours of hard work making repairs pass quickly. When complete, the crew heads to TALDAR III where they eventually part ways with Reom.</p>
					<br>
					<p>With THE MONARCH fully repaired and resupplied, the far reaches of the galaxy await. Chatter on the HoloNet and reports of IsoTech agents reveal Imperial interest in the actions of the crew, giving plenty of reason to keep their heads down. Everything at the edge of the Empire is a gamble....</p>

				<h2>Beyond the Rim - Part IV</h2>
				<h3>11.1.2015</h3>
				<div class="sessionText">
					<p>Set upon once again by the YIYAR CLAN, negotiations fail and a daring chase through the Cholganna skies ensued. With the Monarch  severely damaged, its crew miraculously turns the battle around and blows the rodian gang out of the sky.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Found by the survivors of the SA NALAOR and brought to their hidden retreat, our heroes convince the leaders to throw in with IsoTech and flee the planet. Breaking the sense of hope in camp, an Imperial ship roars into the atmosphere and blocks access to the Monarch. The only way out is by mounting a daring assault on the Imperial scout ship with CAPTAIN REL HARSOL and CRATALA in tow....</p>

				<h3>10.25.2015</h3>
				<div class="sessionText">
					<p>Cholganna, a planet lost for decades has been found, and with it confirmation of the final resting place of the SA NALAOR. It seems the planet itself is trying to keep the Seperatist ship's secrets hidden from the galaxy.</p>
					<br>
					<p>After confronting the fearsome cybernetically enchanced NEXU HYBRIDS and finding a holorecording on the bridge of SA NALAOR, night settles over the planet. With it comes the sounds of jungle predators and the uncertainty of a new dawn....</p>

					<p>Aboard the WHEEL, contact has been made with ISOTECH and a plan set in motion to erase the Death Mark set on the crew of the Monarch. Traveling beyond the Rim and into the jaws of Cholganna is their impossible task.</p>
					<br>
					<p>However with the rescue of IT-3P0 from ruthless Rodian kidnappers, the long-lost Separatist ship, the SA NALAOR, now seems a realistic goal. While waiting for Wheel Security a new technician is forced upon the Monarch, a small amount of insurance for IsoTech. All that is needed now is the clearance to depart and blast off into the unknown....</p>

				<div class="sessionText">
					<p>Amid a backdrop of galactic civil war, a huge space station known as the WHEEL is one of the few places still beyond the Emperor's reach, attracting low-lifes, fortune-seekers, and refugees alike.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Meanwhile, a derelict message pod discovered by an illicit tech company on the Wheel gives new life to old smugglers' stories about a long-lost Separatist treasury ship, the SA NALAOR. The wreck lies at the edge of WILD SPACE, waiting to be found by those brave or crazy enough to look. In order to clear the Death Mark on their heads, the crew of the Monarch heads to the edges of the Mid Rim to begin the hunt....</p>

				<h3>10.4.2015</h3>
				<div class="sessionText">
					<p>It is a dark time for the galaxy. The city of Coruscant, once the glittering pearl of the Republic, now languishes under the shadow of the Galactic Empire. A bustling black market flourishes in the underworld, controlled by the notorious crime syndicate BLACK SUN.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Hired to infiltrate a Black Sun outpost and retrieve vital data on a bounty hunter who betrayed the PYKE crime family, a small group of enterprising individuals works rapidly to access the heavily encrypted Black Sun network as things take a turn for the worse....</p>
