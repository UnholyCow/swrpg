			<h2>Slicing Actions</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="splitLeft">
			<div class="info">
				<h3>Access System</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Difficulty:</strong> <span class="em">Simple (-) Computers Check</span><br>
					<strong>Available To:</strong> Defender, Intruder<br>
					<strong>Description:</strong> For a character to interact with a computer system, that individual must be able to get it to recognize basic commands. For most computers, some sort of indentity verification is required - a code, a key, or takes some other, more esoteric token.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an action, if the system has no verification system, or the character posesses legitimate means of access (such as a code cylinder or passcode), a character may make a <span class="em">Simple (-) Computers Check</span> to gain access to it.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<h3>Activate Security Program</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Difficulty:</strong> <span class="em">Average (<span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span>) Computers Check</span><br>
					<strong>Available To:</strong> Defender, Intruder<br>
					<strong>Description:</strong> Security programs are the main impediment to interlopers in a computer system. As such, anyone trying to subvert a system's intended purpose wants to disable such programs, which anyone protecting the system wants to keep them operational.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an action, a slicer may activate a security program with an <span class="em">Average (<span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span>) Computers Check</span>. While one or more security programs are active on a computer, intruders cannot take certain slicing actions.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<h3>Disable Security Program</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Difficulty:</strong> Computers Check (Difficulty Varies)<br>
					<strong>Available To:</strong> Defender, Intruder<br>
					<strong>Description:</strong> Typically, bringing down the security programs protecting a system is an intruding slicer's first job. If there is an administrator aware of the slicer and actively managing the system, however, keeping the system security suppressed is likely to be an ongoing task.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an action, a slicer may attempt to shut down a security program with a Computers check. The difficulty of this check is based on the quality of the security program, for which the GM can consult the System Security table.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<h3>Enact Command</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Difficulty:</strong> Computers Check (Difficulty Varies)<br>
					<strong>Available To:</strong> Defender, Intruder (if no security programs are active)<br>
					<strong>Description:</strong> The slicer issues a single command to the system he has sliced. Commands are single-purpose requests that fall within the scope of the system. "Loop the past ten seconds of footage on the cameras in this facility that are facing the alley to the north," or "Access all information in this system on Boss Jerod's slave trading," would be valid commands, assuming the system included control of those routines.
				</p>
				<p>
					The difficulty of the Computers checks is up to the GMs discretion, and depends how similar the slicer's command is to the intended use of the system. Unlocking a door controlled by a computer system might require an <span class="em">Easy (<span class="eote di2 contrast">)</span> Computers check</span>, while getting a door's locking mechanics to physically jam might require a <span class="em">Daunting (<span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span>) Computers check</span> instead, as the system is designed to open and close the door, but not to break it.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="splitRight">
			<div class="info">
				<h3>Expel User</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Difficulty:</strong> <span class="em">Opposed Computers vs Computers Check</span><br>
					<strong>Available To:</strong> Defender, Intruder (if no security programs are active)<br>
					<strong>Description:</strong> Once a slicer is aware of another user in the system, the slicer can cause that user to lose access and even impede future access.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an action, a slicer may make an Opposed Computers vs Computers check to cause another user to lose access to the system. If the slicer has identified that user's signature, increase the difficulty of the user's Computers checks for the Access System action by two for this computer until the end of the encounter.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<h3>Lockdown</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Difficulty:</strong> <span class="em">Hard (<span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span>) Computers Check</span><br>
					<strong>Available To:</strong> Defender, Intruder (if no security programs are active)<br>
					<strong>Description:</strong> A user with control of a system can usually shut it down with relative ease. For a slicer attacking a system, this is often the goal, leaving the enemy unable to act until they are able to reset the system. For a slicer on the defensive, it is an option of last resort.
				</p>
				<p>
					As an action, a slicer may make a <span class="em">Hard (<span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span>) Computers Check</span> to shut down the system, blocking access to all users. Any character with physical access to the system can restart it with an <span class="em">Average (<span class="eote di2 contrast"></span><span class="eote di2 contrast"></span>) Computers Check</span> that takes one hour to complete.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="info">
				<h3>Trace User</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Difficulty:</strong> <span class="em">Opposed Computers vs Computers Check</span><br>
					<strong>Available To:</strong> Defender, Intruder (if no security programs are active)<br>
					<strong>Description:</strong> A slicer in a system can attempt to find more information about another user, such as that person's slicing signature or location.
				</p>
				<p>As an action, a slicer may make an Opposed Computers vs Computers check against another user in the system. If he succeeds, he learns the other user's physical location, a portion of the slicer's signature (see SM90), or a full list of the actions the user has taken on the system this encounter.</p>

					<span>Permanent Backdoor (Intruder):</span> The slicer sets up a permanent means of accessing the

					access to a hard line or a connected network.<br>
					<span>Telltale Sign (Defender):</span> The defender looks for a known user hidden amongst junk data.

					threat causes the slicer to unknowlingly leave important access routes into the system. The intruder
